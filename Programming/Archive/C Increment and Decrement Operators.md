## C Increment and Decrement Operators

C programming has two operators increment `++` and decrement `--` to change the value of an operand (constant or variable) by 1.

Increment `++` increases the value by 1 whereas decrement `--` decreases the value by 1. These two operators are unary operators, meaning they only operate on a single operand.

**Example:**
```c

    int a = 10, b = 100;
    float c = 10.5, d = 100.5;

    printf("++a = %d \n", ++a); // Output: 11
    printf("--b = %d \n", --b); // Output: 99
    printf("++c = %f \n", ++c); // Output: 11.5
    printf("--d = %f \n", --d); // Output: 99.5

```

Here, the operators `++` and `--` are used as prefixes. These two operators can also be used as postfixes like `a++` and `a--`.
