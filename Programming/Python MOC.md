# What is Python?

- **Python** is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language "High-level programming language"), [general-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language "General-purpose programming language"). 
- Its design philosophy emphasizes [code readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_readability "Code readability") with the use of [significant indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule "Off-side rule").
- Python is [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#DYNAMIC "Type system") and [garbage-collected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science) "Garbage collection (computer science)"). 
- It supports multiple [programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm"), including [structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming "Structured programming") (particularly [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming")), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming"). 

**It is used for:**
-   web development (server-side)
-   software development
-   mathematics
-   system scripting

### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
-   Python was designed for readability, and has some **similarities to the English language** with influence from mathematics.
-   Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
-   Python relies on **indentation**, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
